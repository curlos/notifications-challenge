## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- Distinguish between "unread" and "read" notifications
- Select "Mark all as read" to toggle the visual state of the unread notifications and set the number of unread messages to zero
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page

## My process

### Built with

- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- CSS

### What I learned

In terms of programming/coding, I didn't learn anything while making this project. It was mostly refinement and shaking off some of the rust from not having used React in a while.

### Continued development

In future projects, I want to improve my estimation of how long projects take me. I currently struggle at estimating how long projects are going to realistically take and end up being too optimistic. I estimated that this challenge would take me 1 hour and 30 minutes to complete but it ended up taking 2 hours and 15 minutes.
